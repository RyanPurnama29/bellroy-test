# 🧩 Bellroy Frontend Engineering Challenge

Hi Bellroy team! 👋  
I'm Ryan, a frontend engineer with a strong focus on clean architecture and great user experience. This is my solution for the Elm + Astro challenge — building a reusable, responsive, and dynamic product card component.

---

## 🔍 What I Built

A fully dynamic **Product Card component**, inspired by Bellroy's product listings, built with:

- ✅ [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) — strictly typed, no runtime exceptions
- ✅ [Astro](https://astro.build/) — modern static site generator
- ✅ Interactive color picker — clicking updates the image in real time
- ✅ Responsive & accessible layout
- ✅ Styled with vanilla CSS for maintainability

## 🙌 Thankyou
 

Thanks for the opportunity to dive into Elm and experiment with Astro! I truly appreciate the balance Bellroy strikes between quality products and beautiful design — and it was fun to reflect that in this component.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,
